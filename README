HexagonMinesweeper

Written by Torben Wichers, Karsten König

Description

This game was part of an exercise of the 1st term programming lecture of the Leibniz Universität Hannover. 
The goal was to program a version of the Microsoft-game Minesweeper with hexagons. Also you should be able 
to solve the game by pushing the key 's'.

Usage

Like the classical Minesweeper but

press 's' -> solve a single-step
hold 's' -> solve the whole game
press 'r' -> load a new game

You need the enclosed "OO-pack.scm"-file in the same directory as HexagonMinesweeper.scm!
